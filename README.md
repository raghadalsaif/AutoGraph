This file will contain your initial steps towards understanding Large Language Models (LLMs), including:

- LLM APIs
- Open source LLMs
- Prompt engineering(prompting guidelines to generate more specific and realistic outputs.)
- Structured output
- AutoGraph project

## File Overview:
- **"OpenAI API":** This file will contain a chat with the OpenAI API.
- **"Open Source LLM":** This file will utilize OLLAMA for prompt engineering.
- **"AutoGraph":** This will be a small project that takes user input such as text, articles, or research papers, and converts it into a JSON file structure for presentation.

# Solution Concept
"AutoGraph" will be a small project that takes user input (e.g., text, articles, research papers) and converts it into a prestaion in structured JSON file.

# Technologies & Tools 🛠️
- Jupyter Lab
- OLLAMA
- NLTK
- OpenAI API
